Reflection on ETL Project Experience
This project gave me hands-on experience building an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to process football player data. The process involved loading a CSV file, modifying the data, and saving it in both JSON and SQLite formats. Overall, some parts were straightforward, while others presented challenges.

What Was Easier Than Expected
Loading and manipulating the CSV file using pandas turned out to be simpler than I thought. Pandas made it easy to load the dataset, inspect columns, and handle basic data manipulation tasks. Similarly, converting the data into JSON and storing it in a SQLite database was quick and efficient. The built-in functions of pandas and SQLite simplified these tasks, allowing for seamless handling of different output formats.

What Was Harder Than Expected
One of the more difficult aspects was ensuring the code could handle unexpected column names or missing columns. For example, when we didn’t have the position column I expected, the script needed to dynamically adjust and skip certain steps. Debugging file paths and ensuring the data pipeline worked across different datasets also required extra attention.

Application to Other Data Projects
This ETL utility can be highly useful for projects involving stock data. Stock data often needs cleaning—removing null values, handling missing dates, and calculating new metrics like daily price changes. A similar pipeline could fetch stock data from an API, clean and transform it, and then store the processed data in a database for further analysis or visualization. Automating this process would make it easier to prepare stock data for machine learning models or financial analysis.

Conclusion
This project taught me how to build a flexible ETL pipeline that can be adapted to different datasets. It reinforced the importance of error handling, cleaning, and transforming data for real-world applications, like stock market analysis, and made me more confident in handling similar projects in the future.
